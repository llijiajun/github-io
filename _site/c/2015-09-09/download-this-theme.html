<p>The Plain is a minimalist Jekyll theme, designed to focus on writing that really matters to you and your audience. Everything else is just a distraction. Nothing more other than useful and understandable information sharing. I have made a final update to this theme. This theme is suit best for personal blog type, but not limited to.</p>

<p><strong><em>Fork</em></strong> or <strong><em>download</em></strong> the theme <a href="https://github.com/heiswayi/the-plain">here on GitHub</a>.</p>
